# JavaScriptCalculator

This is my first educational project, a calculator built using JavaScript. 
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The project also includes two additional calculators: a percent calculator and a random number generator.

The breakdown of usage for the project is as follows:

CSS: 45.8%
JavaScript: 37.6%
HTML: 16.6%

Usage
To use the calculator, simply open the index.html file in your preferred web browser. 
You can then perform calculations using the buttons provided on the calculator's interface. 
Note that certain buttons may be disabled if they cannot be used at the current time, and the calculator also includes parsing, percent calculation, 
and a random number generator.

Additional Calculators
In addition to the basic arithmetic operations, this page also includes two additional calculators:

Percent Calculator: Allows users to calculate the percentage of a given number or numbers.
Random Number Generator: Allows users to generate a random number between two specified values.
